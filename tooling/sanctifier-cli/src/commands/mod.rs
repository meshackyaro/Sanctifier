/// Shared test-only synchronization for `std::env::set_current_dir`, which is

/// must hold this lock for its entire duration (including restoring the
/// original directory), or concurrently-running tests can race: one test may
/// capture another test's temp directory as its "original" CWD just before
/// that temp directory is dropped and deleted, causing `set_current_dir` to
/// fail with `NotFound` and poisoning any lock held at the time.
