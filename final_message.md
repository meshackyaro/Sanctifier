I have completed the task. I created a new contract with intentional bugs and added integration tests to ensure that our analyzer catches them.

You can now review the changes, and if you are satisfied, you can commit them using the following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add integration tests for token contract"
git push origin feat/token-integration-tests-32
```
